# mp3-lengths

Small Python 3 script to print the lengths of a collection of MP3s, or
directories containing MP3s. Requires Mutagen. As command line
arguments, pass any MP3s or directories containing MP3s. With the -r
flag, it will recursively search subdirectories it finds; with the -t
flag it will simply print the total length of every MP3 it saw all
together.
